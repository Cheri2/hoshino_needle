What I want to know are:
A-Side (Normal / 95% jtool, 5% with slopes):
1. Skips
2. Strats that are easy to accidently come up with but actually wrong and making the gameplay worse (Like what you did at corner water grab in atone stage in resolve my module)
3. Physics and Engine bugs
4. Visual and music suggestions
5. Balance
6. Lags and bad optimizations
7. Copyrighted music that kills video or stream (Demonetization is what I don't care because idk who makes money with needle games)
B-Side (Extra / Gimmick) :
I haven't completed it. It will be at least done in several weeks(depending on how much ingenuity I recover by time)

Balances:
I am at 63th floor of the game with 6h 16m playtime, and I found balance being messed up. It's hard to judge because it requires different skillsets in one game. (Precision, Consistency, jtool Gimmicks, Hard input sequences, Luck??? maybe)

Files:
There is a debug version and normal version. Debug keys are standard one. (You don't need any jc/numpad to clear the game)
Some musics can trigger copyright shits. You can replace what's in data folder with any ncs music if you are really concerned about youtube/twitch channel killers.
Debug version will be replaced with practice version in release version maybe???
There are some unfinished sections that does not affect actual gameplay (like setting screen)


Techs:
[Spoiler]









 If you see weird water placement (water3 + fulljump grab but can't fulljump for some reason) at endgame(80+ floors) you have to basically doubletap then hold shift in catharsis water or air. I tried to make it as leinent as possible, but I still need opinions about this stuff because afaik this kind of input is not used in most needle games and some people are walled because of same jump in 'minty freshness'
