~ Info ~
100 floor needle game inspired by Crimson Needle series, albeit being completely distinct in terms of style and gameplay. Mostly water-vine-platform things. Later on the game things get spiced up and become a bit precise, requiring multiple different inputs to be done consecutively.
Read ruleset.txt before complaining something being wrong.
May be balanced badly. My skill level fluctuated constantly while making this.

~ Text files ~
readme : this
ruleset : niche engine behaviour explained
no : my life

~ Contents ~
100 'A-Side' Screens, Max 75 difficulty in my scale.
20 'B-Side' Screens, Slightly harder than A-side.
Very Hard mode of each sides, which reduces amount of saves by roughly 2.5:1 ratio. Probably Mid HoF level, just because some jumps being really inconsistent.

~ Control ~
Arrow - Move
Shift - Jump 
Z - Shoot
P - Pause
R - Restart
F4 - Fullscreen

~ Setting ~
For yuuutu-like (Standard) experience, set it to:
Scaling Filter = None
Animations = Fangames
Left + Right Mode = Right
Save Valign = Don't Save
If it is laggy as hell, set Graphics = Fast.
This game is compatible with most gamepad, but you have to configure keybinds manually.
Please don't complain about bad physics unless you set these options correctly.
Set bow color to Dichotomy if you don't want to lose djump and somehow not know it happening. The game is much less confusing with it, if you get used to it!!























































































































































~ Extra Notes ~
You don't have to, and don't want to read these unless you really want to know more about me. If it's that case, just know that it's not really positive story. I tried my best to remove anything CW worthy, but I don't know??? it's your risk.


No paragraph separation because why not. Good luck reading this monstrosity. This is long stream of thoughts.

If you have seen me in IWC or other fangame related community, you probably already found that I'm pretty insecure person. (Clearly mentally healthy one can't freaking make hard 100 floor game in a month!!) I suffered from mental health problems for like 10 years, and I had to take GED equivalent of my region to even complete primary education because I couldn't attend school without being depressed too much. In the second to last year of school (7th grade I guess???) I met ERS(Steak guy) at school, and he taught me how to play and make fangames. I had some fun time dropping intentionally stupid stuffs into Delfruit with him. (Million gatejump vs Steak series. What an epic battle..) After quitting school I had lost interest in fangames for several years, then somehow came back with releasing 'I wanna be the Tori Another'. This game is intended to be reasonable version of 'I wanna be the Tori' series, which is atrocious L-game which includes something like 4.5 ledge iirc. Tori Another was really low effort game but somehow it hits and got pretty good rating - This was a disaster. I started to repeat making a lot of 'low-effort' needles and releasing them in short period, then having rest for like random(300) days. These games were not really polished and inevitably got bad reviews, but I could not really see my games objectively back then so I got really upset with this, ending up dropping depressed posts every couple day on iwc, even causing small argument/drama about delfruit ratings. Nowadays I pretend to see my games objectively and always say my game is bad. Probably I manipulated myself to protect my mental health or my game is really not that good????? Recently I'm not releasing game on 'OccultCube' alias. This is not really related to my identity/etc issues but I just wanted to clean up my old history. I used to care a lot about fangame history, even re-releasing my discarded and private games. However this is the choice I had to do for myself. Nobody would care about my games unless they're doing roulette, since I'm not really a prominent person in community, and it might be blissful?? idk I saw many cases of being 'main' character in a community making their life harder by various reasons. Anyways, this is the culmination of my past 7-8?? years of (rather intermittent) needle making. Anything I would make in future cannot be better than this, unless I somehow change a lot inside. I worked for this like 70 hours per week, because it somehow fixed me feeling insecure while working for it. Good luck if you're actually want to play this, because it would be big challenge to most players. I designed it in a way that player needs strats to do things consistently. Don't do this like a precision L-game and just cheese with mindless fullcancels. It would be unfun. I always miss younger me coming up with minty fresh ideas everyday, and had brain capacity to make something like variety 100. I'm decayed to a generic needle maker. :L

~ FAQ ~
1. Why your username is (Insert something here)??????
OccultCube is an RNG item in Korean MMORPG 'Maplestory'.
ナヒーダ is a character in Genshin Impact.
Stella is just the first English name that came into my mind when I was changing my username.
2. Why did you change your username?????
My original discord username was Cheri, which caused some confusion in IWC because of uh oh. I can't change username in IWC so I changed main discord name. Nice.
3. How you can always (insert something here about my games)???
Title of my games are usually inspired by anything I saw irl or online.
Examples :
ingenuity - In Genshin Impact there are an item called Philosophy of Ingenuity. It is required to upgrade Nahida's skillset.
Clarity - From Cardcaptor Sakura OST 'CLEAR'.
Moonstone - From league of legends item 'Moonstone Renewer'.
I wanna be the Tori - Tori is plural of Torus, which is 2D orientable closed surface with genus 1. (Basically hollow doughnut if you don't get it)
I wanna make a wish to a shooting star together with you (This game!) - 25400% more wholesome version of I wanna stop crying myself to sleep. Basically something that someone would do at 2am.
angel ring - From Maplestory item 'Guardian Angel Ring'
Victoria Needle - Victoria is a color!! (like crimson) It's like pale blue?? I don't know how to explain
Visuals are from shadertoy, random stock photo websites, jtool skins, etc. Just learned some color theory from internet.
4. Uptime?
KST = UTC+9:00 (No Summer Time all year)
I am usually available from 8AM to 1AM. Totally enough sleep :3
i.e. I wake up when ninz turns on stream, and sleep before Stonk turns on stream.
5. Please take care of yourself

No. I take core of myself instead. Listen to this rather than concerning about me.
6. Will you make (something)???
Precision Needle - What I do make is already precision stuff. If you want hard precision techy stuff it would likely not happen because I don't have enough knowledge
FTFA-like - I can attempt to make it but I can't test it because I am too unskilled.
osu/etterna/bms charts - Only dump/delay/techs because these are only things I find interesting.
Secret Santa Game - Maybe? but I can't make anything moving so I am scared to get some requests like an avoidance or short adventure.
Celeste Mods - Oh god why (I want to make one someday but I don't know anything about it)
Remake of my old games - No. Why someone would think generic needle remake can be good needle????
Streams - Yes. But at super random times, and no mic because I can't speak English well.
7. Can I dm or talk with you?
Yes unless you're inherently bad person who wants to take advantage of insecure and dumb person like me.
