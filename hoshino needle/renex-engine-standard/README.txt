~ Info ~
100 floor needle game inspired by Crimson Needle series, albeit being completely distinct in terms of style and gameplay. Mostly water-vine-platform things. Later on the game things get spiced up and become a bit precise, requiring multiple different inputs to be done consecutively.
Read ruleset.txt before complaining something being wrong.
May be balanced badly. My skill level fluctuated constantly while making this.

~ Contents ~
100 'A-Side' Screens, Max 75 difficulty in my scale.
20 'B-Side' Screens, Slightly harder than A-side.
Very Hard mode of each sides, which reduces amount of saves by roughly 2.5:1 ratio. Probably Mid HoF level, just because some jumps being really inconsistent.

~ Control ~
Arrow - Move
Shift - Jump 
Z - Shoot
P - Pause
R - Restart
F4 - Fullscreen

~ Setting ~
For yuuutu-like (Standard) experience, set it to:
Scaling Filter = None
Animations = Fangames
Left + Right Mode = Right
Save Valign = Don't Save
If it is laggy as hell, set Graphics = Fast.
This game is compatible with most gamepad, but you have to configure keybinds manually.
Please don't complain about bad physics unless you set these options correctly.
Set bow color to Dichotomy if you don't want to lose djump and somehow not know it happening. The game is much less confusing with it, if you get used to it!!
