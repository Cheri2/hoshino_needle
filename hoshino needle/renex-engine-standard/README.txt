~ Info ~
100 floor needle game inspired by Crimson Needle series, albeit being completely distinct in terms of style and gameplay. Mostly water-vine-platform things. Later on the game things get spiced up and become a bit precise, requiring multiple different inputs to be done consecutively.
Read ruleset.txt before complaining something being wrong.
May be balanced badly. My skill level fluctuated constantly while making this.

This is explaination about how to configure the game.
First of all, you can access config screen by pausing in-game or from save select screen.

Music Volume : The volume of background music. Set to zero if you're streaming and concerned about copyright strikes.
Sound Volume : The volume of SFX (e.g. Jump, Death, Shoot, etc)
Screen Mode : Whether the game is on 'fullscreen' or windowed. Note that this is usually not exclusive fullscreen, and equivalent to 'Borderless' in more standard language. If you want exclusive fullscreen, continue reading.
Window Zoom : Pixel stretching. May or may not be integer scaling.
Scaling Filter : When you scale stuffs with non-integer scale, this will decide how it would interpolate pixels.
Player : ???
Blood Amount : Amount of gore. Off is family friendly, and High is pretty bloody.
Screenshake : Unused I guess?? If you are photosensitive it's safe to set it to 0% tho
Left+Right Mode : Which direction you would go when you press L+R. Should be set to Right unless you know what you're doing.
Graphics : Whetehr shaders will be used or not. Most laggy part is surface tricks so it would not improve performance a lot anyways. Intended for people who prefer static backgrounds.
Water Layer : Depth order of water, spike and player. Purely visual stuff.
Save valign : Enabling this will save your subpixels. Be careful because it can break some well-known setups that are somehow valign-dependent.
Bow Color : Visual cue of your double jump state. Dichotomy is recommended but if you want sensory overload there are more modes.
Platforms : Whether platform would be fully snapless or semi-snapless. Difference is that semi-snapless platform snaps when you walkoff then turnaround immediately. You can also choose classic platforms but you ABSOLUTELY don't want to.
Vines : Vine codes. Not really much difference but exists to be safe.
Low Latency : Experimental exclusive fullscreen (GMS1.4-like) mode. Very buggy and probably environment-dependent. You should rather use external tools like SpecialK if you can. Note that you may get several harmless error message if you enable this!

For yuuutu-like (Standard) experience, set it to:
Scaling Filter = None
Animations = Fangames
Left + Right Mode = Right
Save Valign = Don't Save
If it is laggy as hell, set Graphics = Fast.
This game is compatible with most gamepad, but you have to configure keybinds manually.
Please don't complain about bad physics unless you set these options correctly.
Set bow color to Dichotomy if you don't want to lose djump and somehow not know it happening. The game is much less confusing with it, if you get used to it!!

 ~RULESET / ENGINE BEHAVIOUR DETAILS ~
Read this before complaining something is wrong!!
These are for more smooth gameplay, and usually make the game easier.

1. Platform does not snap. This is configurable but you absolutely want to set it as either 'Semi-Snapless' or 'Full Snapless' in certain screens. It makes your life a lot easier!!
2. Key input is not flushed at room start. (Although autosave exists so you don't lose progress after warp)
3. If you get stuck between ceiling and platform, you just fall down instead of getting softlocked. !!This applies to rotated platform too!! Don't attempt to assassinate me because you phased through rotated platform to death.
4. Platform + Vine should work fine unlike standard renex engine, but there might be some niche inaccuracy cases that are absolutely unrelated to actual gameplay.
5. Savepoint hitbox is 32x32 square. You can save at the edge of block. You can't saveboost. Don't try.
6. You can change whether y-subpixel is saved or not in setting.
7. You can change what happens if you press both arrow key at once. Default behaviour is same as yuuutu and it is intended way to playing, but you can get advantage over it if you want to.
8. Slopes are 45 degrees from ground, while spikes are arctan(1/2) degrees. Don't get confused.
