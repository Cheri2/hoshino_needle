Because Elon is stupid I prefer discord. (I check twitter like every 2 months)

~ Info ~
100 floor needle game inspired by Amaranth Needle and Madoka Needle. Mostly water-vine-platform things.
Read ruleset.txt before complaining something being wrong.
May be not balanced. My skill level fluctuated constantly while making this.

~ Control ~
Arrow - Move
Shift - Jump 
Z - Shoot
P - Pause
R - Restart
F4 - Fullscreen

~ Setting ~
For yuuutu-like (Standard) experience, set it to:
Scaling Filter = None
Animations = Fangames
Left + Right Mode = Right
Save Valign = Don't Save
If it is laggy as hell, set Graphics = Fast.
This game is compatible with most gamepad, but you have to configure keybinds manually.
